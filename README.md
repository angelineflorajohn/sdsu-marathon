AJAX to verify that the form to be submitted is not a duplicate.
A php script that reads the parameters from the form and stores them in your MySQL database on opatija.sdsu.edu. We will discuss database design and a sample DB schema will be provided.

A report that gives the roster of the runners, grouped by category (teen, adult, senior) and alphabetized by last name. The report should contain the following information:
Runner's last name, first name
The runner's image
Runner's age at the time the report is generated
Runner's experience level.
the report must be accessible only after a login.
A confirmation page
